        for each individual number in the NUMBER you're trying to expand

        I want to create an array of numbers that represent each number
        so for 12 we should get [10, 2]
        We first create an array of numbers to add each number to
        We then have to treat our main NUMBER as if it was a list
        let's call it num_list from here on, it's still a number
        but we're treating it as if it's a list to get numbers from
