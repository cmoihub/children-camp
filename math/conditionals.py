    Conditionals help the computer to take multiple decisions based on what
    we tell it
    It's like how your parents give you food if you're hungry
    If you're not something else should happen (of course some people eat regardless
    of whether they're hungry or not, which is why they blow up like balloons
    but that's another day's story, read 3 John 1:2 && 1 Cor 6:12 for more)

    The goal of this exercise is to have you play around with conditionals via
    if, elif & else combos
    And also nesting conditionals ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
