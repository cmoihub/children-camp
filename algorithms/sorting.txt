Check if the item next to me is smaller
Then go to the next pair and so on and so forth

insertion
Pick the next item and put it in the correct position

for i = 2:n,
    for (k = i; k > 1 and a[k] < a[k-1]; k--)
        swap a[k,k-1]
    â†’ invariant: a[1..i] is sorted
end

selection
Always find smallest elem in arr 
Place at beginning 

for i = 1:n,
    k = i
    for j = i+1:n, if a[j] < a[k], k = j
    â†’ invariant: a[k] smallest of a[i..n]
    swap a[i,k]
    â†’ invariant: a[1..i] in final position
end

merge
An example of merge sort. First divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.
