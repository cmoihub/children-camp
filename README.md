To run the penguin apps in a folder of choice run the following commands

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cmoihub/children-camp.git
$ cd children-camp && cd penguin-bit-by-bit
$ python -m venv venv # use python3 if this doesn't work
$ source ./venv/bin/activate # for windows use .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter lab .
```
